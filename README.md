# Spark-SQL---Case-Study-
In this case study, we are giving a real-world example of how to use Spark-SQL on top of the HADOOP for different exploratory data analysis. 
In here, we have a predefined dataset (yellow_tripdata_2015-01-06.csv) having more than 15 columns. 
I have done this case study under guidance of Intellipaat Big data Hadoop training.
